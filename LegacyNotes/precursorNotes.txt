From 3/21/18
Was planning on using two webservers to handle the files for me:
png2jpg.com
&&
TinyPNG.com

Upload files to the site(s) for processing
Wait
download result files

upload X at a time
upload all from a given folder location.

extract the zipped files to a new location

calculate the number of files to process to estimate times, show progress. (Verbose)

Run through folders recusively

verify that all files had been successfully transferred
--retransfer missing/failed files
