Shrink Images. 
Choose a top directory.

-Should be used on a copy of files in case something goes wrong. ALWAYS Backup!

-If ImageMagick is not installed, this script will remove any PNG files it finds.
-This Script is not friendly for PNGs that rely on transparency. Results may vary.

-Any editing you wish to do to your images should be done before running this script.

This script is intended for making images more bandwidth friendly and/or shrinking them for personal archiving.
